"""
V13 — One-shot reclassification of legacy NULL royal_category rows.

Background job that scans the events table for rows where
royal_category IS NULL (legacy V10/V11 imports) and reapplies the
V12 classify_event() heuristic. Runs once at startup, then exits.

Safe to call repeatedly: rows that already carry a royal_category are
skipped, and the operation is wrapped in SAVEPOINTs at the DB layer so
a malformed row cannot poison the whole batch.
